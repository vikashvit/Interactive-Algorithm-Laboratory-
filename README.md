# Interactive-Algorithm-Laboratory-
Project objective :- Algorithm Laboratory   Version 1.0  is a desktop based application developed in Java framework.
Problem:- presently students are developing algorithms in command line which does not make it very interactive. 
Solution of the above problem is to developed GUI based software and implement algorithms, so that developers can understand the algorithm interactively by changing the input in GUI
I have implemented following algorithms
1 Sorting Algo
2 CPU Scheduling Algo
3 Greedy Algo
4 Matrix Multiplication
